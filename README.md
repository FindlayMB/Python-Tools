# Python-Tools
Some simple tools I have written in python to help me with some of my courses.


## Laplace Trend Test tool

### How to run

```cmd
python laplaceTrendTest.py <file path>
```
File to run the trend test on has to be in the following format.
```csv
T,FC
1,2
2,3
3,4
```

Both columns T and FC need to be able to convert to numpy.float32.
